  MappingRelevance:
    description: >-
      How useful is this cluster as a target for mapping experimental data?
      Used to prioritize clusters in search results for mapping workflows.
    permissible_values:
      high:
        description: >-
          Core physics quantities commonly measured in experiments.
          These are primary targets for data mapping activities.
          Examples: Te, Ti, ne, Ip, Bt, q-profile, boundary shape,
          magnetic flux, plasma current, heating power.
        meaning: imas:high_relevance
        annotations:
          priority: 1
          boost_factor: 0.25

      medium:
        description: >-
          Secondary or derived quantities, diagnostic-specific data,
          transport coefficients, fitting parameters.
          Examples: diffusion coefficients, reconstructed profiles,
          fit quality metrics, derived transport fluxes.
        meaning: imas:medium_relevance
        annotations:
          priority: 2
          boost_factor: 0.15

      low:
        description: >-
          Metadata, indices, coordinate definitions, rarely-populated fields,
          internal code parameters, provenance information.
          Examples: code identifiers, grid indices, method descriptions,
          source references.
        meaning: imas:low_relevance
        annotations:
          priority: 3
          boost_factor: 0.0
